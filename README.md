# Skin Lesion Segmentation

## Introduction
Skin is an extraordinary human structure that often suffers from several known and unknown diseases. According to dermatology, it is a regular practice to conduct extensive tests on patients to ascertain the type of skin illness they have been afflicted with. The duration of time varies from one practitioner to the next, depending on their experience. Therefore, the diagnosis of human skin diseases is the most uncertain and sophisticated branch of science. It has been observed that most of the cases remain disregarded due to the shortage of higher medical infrastructure and facilities.

## Project Aim
My work aims at providing an automated image-based method for diagnosing and categorizing skin problems. This method uses image processing and machine learning classification techniques. With an easy-to-use User Interface, I aim to make the process of diagnosing skin diseases more accessible and efficient.

## Features
- **Automated Diagnosis**: The system uses advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to diagnose and categorize skin diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system has been designed with a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy for anyone to use.
- **Segmentation Image Filter**: I have added a segmentation image filter for better image analysis and accurate classification results.

## Conclusion
This project aims to make the diagnosis of skin diseases more accessible and efficient. By leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, I hope to contribute to the field of dermatology and help those suffering from skin diseases get the help they need. I believe that technology can play a crucial role in healthcare, and this project is a step in that direction.
